.about
  %p I'm from the UK but wanted to come and work in Barcelona because there are so many exciting things happening with its hardware community right now.
  %p I'm a web developer by trade (Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL/NoSQL) but I also like making apps and hacking prototypes together whenever I get the opportunity. When I'm not using some type of keyboard I'm probably running or sleeping.
  %p I feel privileged to be on this course and can't wait to start getting my hands dirty with the tools that we'll be learning to use.
  %p Oh... I think bees are cool too.
